# Shaka Player Playback Technology for Video.js 

Shaka Player Playback Technology allows Video.js users to utilize [Shaka-Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player) to playback MPEG DASH videos. This project is still under development, more features and enhancements will be available later.

### Dependencies
  - [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs)
  - [Video.js Font](https://github.com/videojs/font)
  - [Shaka-Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player)

### Build
```
npm install
npm run build
```

### Run
```
npm run serve
```

### Usage
  - Include player-skin.js and player.full.js file in the html page.
  - Specify "shaka" in the techOrder array as needed.
  - Look at the included example for guidance.
  
### Example
An example is provided under the /example directory. Run the build script before using this example.

### Screenshot
Below is a screenshot of videojs-shaka-player playing an MPEG DASH (VP9/Vorbis) VoD playlist. By default, the video is played back adaptively. The quality menu (gear) is automatically populated based on the size and bitrates of the video streams listed in the playlist. You can manually select a video quality to override auto (adaptive) mode, and switch back to auto mode at any time.
