# Shaka Player Playback Technology for Video.js 

Shaka Player Playback Technology allows Video.js users to utilize [Shaka-Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player) to playback MPEG DASH videos. This project is still under development, more features and enhancements will be available later.

If you want VideoJS 5 support, check out the vjs5 branch of this project.

### Dependencies
  - [Video.js](https://github.com/videojs)
  - [Video.js Font](https://github.com/videojs/font)
  - [Shaka-Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player)

### Build
Build script requires npm, bower and grunt.

If you don't have bower or grunt, run:

```
sudo npm install grunt
sudo npm install grunt-cli
sudo npm install bower
sudo npm install grunt-contrib-connect
```

Finally, run ./build.sh

### Usage
  - Include shaka-player.compiled.js and video.shaka.dev.js file in the html page.
  - Specify "shaka" in the techOrder array as needed.
  - Look at the included example for guidance.
  
### Example
An example is provided under the /example directory. Run the build script before using this example.

### Screenshot
Below is a screenshot of videojs-shaka-player playing an MPEG DASH (VP9/Vorbis) VoD playlist. By default, the video is played back adaptively. The quality menu (gear) is automatically populated based on the size and bitrates of the video streams listed in the playlist. You can manually select a video quality to override auto (adaptive) mode, and switch back to auto mode at any time.

### Icon
The provided example is using the cog icon from [videojs/font](https://github.com/videojs/font). You are free to use any other icon font to replace the existing one with the help of extra css rules.

### Special Thanks
